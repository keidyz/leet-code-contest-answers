# leet-code-contest-answers
This repository was made
- mostly to keep myself accountable
- to show the other people in the lc discussions possible solutions to some questions they might've missed
- to gather other solutions/improve on them while people still have their contest high on

This repository will be updated with every one of my or your(feel free to send a pr) contest answer right after the contest ends so it won't be in violation of the contest guidelines.

Every LeetCode contest I participate in will be in this repository, Weekly and Bi-Weekly answers included.
